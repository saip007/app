            <h2>Hey, I am Saip</h2>
            <h4>learner, Software Engineer and Security Researcher</h4>
            <div class="about-contaniner-description">
                <p>I’m a Security Researcher specializing in Cyber Security with a focus on reviewing the source code of open-source packages in ecosystems like NPM, PyPI, Maven, and Ruby. I have 2 years of experience in analyzing code to identify and report malicious activities, such as exfiltration of sensitive information, and verifying binaries through platforms like VirusTotal and online sandboxes.<br><br>
                    Before this role, I completed a two-month internship at the same company, where I developed Python-based web scrapers for hundreds of sites to automate the extraction of security advisories.<br><br>
                    I hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I gained knowledge in programming languages like Python, C/C++, Java, and JavaScript, along with basic skills in data structures, machine learning, and web development. Although my academic background doesn’t include formal training in Cyber Security, my hands-on experience has honed my skills in code analysis and problem-solving.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m passionate about coding, developing solutions, and tackling challenges creatively. My career interests are diverse—I’m open to opportunities in software development, Cyber Security, or even further studies. I’m also exploring ways to grow my network, generate multiple income sources, and pursue personal interests like blogging, vlogging, and fitness.</p>
